# Hackbright Project: Recipes

Recipes is my final project for the frontend specialization of the hackbright + shipt mini bootcamp. It's a simple app that shows a random list of recipes, and allows a user to favorite or search recipes. I have built a basic version of this in Swift using a static recipes file and this allowed me to focus more on all of the additional logic and styling this time around in React Native.
