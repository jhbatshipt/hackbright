# Exercise: Create a Webpage

Create a webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS.

<br>
<br>

## Make a Plan

Decide what you want to make your page about. For example, you can display information about a hobby, a book, a movie, an event, a place, etc.!

> ### Can’t decide on a topic? Need placeholder text or images?
>
> If you can’t decide on a topic, you can generate placeholder text with a Lorem ipsum generator. [We recommend this one at loremipsum.io](https://loremipsum.io/) (they even have a list of image generators you can use for placeholder images).

<br>

## Create a Mockup

Sketch out a basic layout (you can do this anywhere since you won’t need to submit it). For inspiration, [check out this article from MDN Web Docs on common web layouts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Design_and_accessibility/Common_web_layouts).

<br>
<br>

## Set Up Your Files

Create a folder for your project. Inside that folder, create two files: **_index.html_** and **_style.css_**.

<br>
<br>

## Start Building the Page

Open your project folder in VS Code and start coding. We recommend starting with the HTML and move on to working on the CSS once you have the basic structure of the page.

> ### Use VS Code completions to automate generating a HTML5 boilerplate
>
> You can use VS Code’s built-in **_Emmet snippet_** expansion support to generate a HTML5 boilerplate. In an HTML file, start typing `html` and use your arrow keys to select the `html:5` option. Then, press Return to expand the snippet.
