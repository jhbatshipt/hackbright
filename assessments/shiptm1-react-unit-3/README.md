# React Native Unit 3 Assessment


## Getting started

This folder contains three demo files to support a simple webpage with 3 sections in the HTML:

- About Me
- My Activities
- Generate an Activity

You can run the demo by opening the `demo-index.html` file in your browser. The CSS and JS files are already imported.


## Assessment Tasks


#### Recreate the demo code using React

Open up the project files in your editor and look through each of the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 

Your task will be to recreate this demo page using React. 

You should generate your react application using `create-react-app` and will be submitting that app as your assessment this week.
