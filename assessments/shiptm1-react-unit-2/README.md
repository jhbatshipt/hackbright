# React Native Unit 2 Assessment

## Getting started

Install Express using npm:

$ `npm i express`

Then, run the server:

$ `node app.js`

Finally, open the code in your editor, then navigate to `localhost:4000` in the browser of your choice.


## Assessment Tasks

#### Multiple Choice

Please refer to discord to complete the multiple choice portion of this assessment. You should receive an invitation to your email.

#### DOM Manipulation

When you start the server and navigate to localhost:4000, you will see a webpage with 3 features.

Your task is to make these features work! You can find the instructions for each prompt located in `public/javascripts/domManipulation.js`.

_Note: There will be no need to edit `app.js` or `index.html` to make this work. All of your work will be done in `domManipulation.js`._

#### Object Orientation

Your task is to create your own class that subclasses a class we have provided. More details and instructions are located in `public/javascripts/objectOrientation.js`.

_Note: As above, you will only need to make changes to `objectOrientation.js` to complete this task. Additionally, you can stop your server to work on this portion as there will be no browser-related code to execute or test._
