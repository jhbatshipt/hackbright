# Exercise: Dice Roller

Practice working with state and handling events by adding features to the Dice Roller app.

<br>

## Getting started

This exercise comes with starter code in a **\*_.zip_** file. Unzip the file where you normally store your React projects and open it in VS Code. Then, follow the steps below to install the dependencies and run the app.

In the VS Code terminal, run **_npm install_** to install the dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

When the dependencies are installed, run **_npm start_** to start the app.

```
$ npm start
```

### An overview of the starter code

**_App.js_** renders placeholders for the final app’s UI and features. These features are missing — your assignment will be to implement them!

We’ve also included a **_Dice_** component in **_components/Dice.js_**. To see how it works, view the app in your browser. You should see three boxes with numbers. Try clicking on them and notice that the numbers change. Each box is rendered by a **_Dice_** component.

## Your tasks

Add the following features to the Dice Roller app:

- Users should be able to add dice to the app. They should be able to specify the number of sides on the dice that they want to add.

- Currently, you can only roll each die individually. Add a feature so users can roll all the dice at once by clicking a button.
